## Installation

Clone the repo locally then install all the dependencies using [NPM](https://npmjs.org/)

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/AlQaholic007/auxilium.git
$ cd auxilium
$ npm i
```

## Local Development

Before running the app, you will need to add the Google API Credentials to the project. Under the `config` directory of the repo, you will find `google.js`. Replace `<CLIENT_ID>`, `<CLIENT_SECRET>` and `<host>:<port>` with your own API credentials

```javascript
/** REPLACE YOUR API CREDENTIALS HERE **/
var in_client_id = 'XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX', // <CLIENT_ID>
    in_client_secret = 'XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX', // <CLIENT_SECRET>
```

Now Replace the `<host>` & `<port>` with the redirect uri specified  [Google API Dashboard](https://developers.google.com). Default is `http://localhost:8080/account/oauth`.

```javascript
var in_redirect_uri = "http://localhost:8080/account/oauth/:service";
```

Finally start the MongoDB server in a seperate bash/pm2

```bash
$ mongod
```

and then start the auxilium server via `npm`.

```bash
$ npm start
```
